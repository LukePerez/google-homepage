>>INTRO<<

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
This is my first project with The Odin Project.
I will be attempting both the easy and the difficult webpage replications.

>>INITIAL THOUGHTS<<
I have some base knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JAvascript, but I have not
attempted anything like this. I expect it to be challenging, stimulating, and fun.

>>POST-PROJECT REFLECTIONS<<
